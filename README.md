## Introduction

### What is Shell
A **Shell** is a command-line interpreter, it is the program that provides a user interface to access the services of the operating system. Depending on the type of interface they use, shells can be of various types, in this case, a shell program of the type **`sh`** ([Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)) will be developed. Users typically interact with a shell using a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) that is used for entering data into and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system.

### What is it for
This consists of interpreting orders. It incorporates features such as process control, input/output redirection, law listing and reading, protection, communications, and a command language for writing batch programs or scripts. All Unix-type systems have at least one interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell. The Bourne shell program is found within the Unix file hierarchy at **`/bin/sh`**.
